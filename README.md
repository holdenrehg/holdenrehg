### Hello! My name is Holden. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub.

I am an engineering manager over at [PlayStation](https://playstation.com), but used to spend much more time writing code (especially Python) as a software developer/freelancer/consultant. Happy to say that I've been working on web software for what feels like a long time now.

Outside of work, I've been spending time exploring hobby game development and engines. [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) has been my poison of choice at the moment for prototyping and learning.
