### Hey, I'm Holden. ðŸ™‹

Welcome to the place where I keep all my code.

I'm a software developer, freelancer, consultant based out of Saint Louis, MO, USA who's been working on web related stuff for what feels like a long time now. Most recently I've been focused on [python](https://github.com/topics/python) and [odoo](https://github.com/topics/odoo), but have worked in a bunch of languages, platforms and frameworks over the last 10 years. I've worked with a couple dozen US based businesses on small, medium, and large scale software projects as either a developer, team leader, project manager, or consultant.

Reach out [via email](mailto:holdenrehg@gmail.com) ðŸ“« if you think I could help you or your team out. I'm always looking to work on new interesting projects, contribute to more open source (most of my work has been closed source ðŸ˜ž), or learn new technologies (have been experimenting with game dev recently).
